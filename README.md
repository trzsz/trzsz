## Why?

I love to use [iTerm2 integrating with tmux](https://iterm2.com/documentation-tmux-integration.html) to manage terminal sessions.

Sometimes, I need to transfer some files between my laptop and the remote server.

Considering `laptop -> hostA -> hostB -> docker -> tmux` , using scp to transfer files is inconvenience.

[Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) is not going to support lrzsz ( rz / sz ) ( [906](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/issues/906), [1439](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/issues/1439) ), and I found out that creating a new file transfer tools is much easier than patching tmux.

Additionally, [iTerm2-zmodem](https://github.com/RobberPhex/iTerm2-zmodem) is not supporting a progress bar. Is there something wrong happened or just need more time?


## Requirements
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
  * Pythonâ€™s standard library is good enough.
* [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/index.html)
  * [Tmux Integration](https://iterm2.com/documentation-tmux-integration.html) and [Coprocesses](https://iterm2.com/documentation-coprocesses.html) are so cool.
  * `btw` without tmux works too.
* [zenity](https://github.com/ncruces/zenity)
  * Optional for a nice progress bar.


## Installation

### Server side

* Install [trzsz-svr](https://pypi.org/project/trzsz-svr)
  ```
  sudo python3 -m pip install --upgrade trzsz-libs trzsz-svr
  ```


### Client side

* Install [trzsz-iterm2](https://pypi.org/project/trzsz-iterm2)
  ```
  sudo python3 -m pip install --upgrade trzsz-libs trzsz-iterm2
  ```
  After installation, `which trzsz-iterm2` should output `/usr/local/bin/trzsz-iterm2`, if not:
  * `which trzsz-iterm2` shows nothing, check the output of the previous installation.
  * `which trzsz-iterm2` shows another path, create a soft link:\
    `sudo ln -sv $(which trzsz-iterm2) /usr/local/bin/trzsz-iterm2`


* Install [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/index.html) and create a [Trigger](https://iterm2.com/documentation-triggers.html) as follows.

  | Name | Value |
  | ---- | ---- |
  | Regular Expression | `:(:TRZSZ:TRANSFER:[SR]:\d+\.\d+\.\d+)` |
  | Action | `Run Silent Coprocess` |
  | Parameters | `/usr/local/bin/trzsz-iterm2 \1` |
  | Enabled | âœ… |

* `Optional` install [zenity](https://github.com/ncruces/zenity) for a nice progress bar.
  ```
  brew install ncruces/tap/zenity
  ```
  After installation, `which zenity` should output `/usr/local/bin/zenity`, if not:
  * `which zenity` shows nothing, check the output of the previous installation.
  * `which zenity` shows another path, create a soft link:\
    `sudo ln -sv $(which zenity) /usr/local/bin/zenity`
